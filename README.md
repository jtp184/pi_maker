# PiMaker

Easy bake for Raspberry Pi

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'pi_maker', github: 'jtp184/pi_maker'
```

You can also download and install it globally with

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jtp184/pi_maker.git
cd pi_maker
rake install
```

## Hardware & Imaging

This gem was tested with various SD cards, on Mac and Linux operating systems, and with the Raspberry Pi 3+ and 4.

Software images can be downloaded from [raspberrypi.org](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/) directly or through torrent. I reccomend the full desktop version for the preinstalled software tools, but pi_maker can write any `.img` file.

## CLI

Most of the CLI commands and subcommands can be run with the `--interactive` option to prompt for selection when needed.

### `pantry`

### `wifi`
